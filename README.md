I've developed a Prison Life script, which includes a premium section featuring:
- FE Server Crash
- FE Ear Rape
- FE Kick [Kicks tigeradmin users]
- FE Anti Crash

All of these features are fully functional and ready for use. While the premium script is currently not for sale, the standard version is being released.

Script: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arxhiewt/Prison-Life/main/Slient-Aim",true))()` - Updated 18/08/24
